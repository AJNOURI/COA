The following is a collection of exercices to get familiar with Openstack administration through the cli for the purpose of preparing for COA (Openstack Foundation Openstack Certified Administrator) exam:

### CLI administration section:

  * Instances

### Troubleshooting section:

I am collecting all issues I've encountered during the learning process and beyond in the [issue section](https://github.com/AJNOURI/COA/issues).  
  
Opened sections are still under investigation, closed are solved.

If you are lucky enough, you'll make a lot of mistakes to learn from and be prepared for the exam :)
